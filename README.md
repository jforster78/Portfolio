# Portfolio

The simplicity of the website is to showcase my portfolio of web design and development, where I have used HTML, SCSS and BEM methodology, Vinilla JavaScript ES6 and basic SEO to demonstarte my work.

The idea of a one page website appealled to me on this occassion as I wanted to showcase me skills, my web design and development only.  I hope to have achieved this without the use of multiple pages, which would have been full of useless information.  By keeping it simple I have displayed only what is needed and direct.

I have used keyword research, meta tags, sitemap.xml, robots.txt and semantics to improve my SEO.

Kind regards
