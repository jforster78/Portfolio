# Portfolio

The simplicity of the website is to showcase my portfolio of web design and development, where I have used HTML5, SCSS(CSS3), BEM methodology, Vinilla JavaScript ES6 and basic 
SEO to demonstarte my work.

The idea of this website appealled to me; as I wanted to showcase me skills, my web design and development. I hope to have achieved this through the use of multiple web pages and self built web components. By keeping this simple I have displayed only what I believ is needed for the users experience.

I have used keyword research, meta tags, sitemap.xml, robots.txt and semantics to improve my SEO.

Kind regards

James Forster
