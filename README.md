# Portfolio

The simplicity of the website is to showcase my portfolio of web design and development, 
where I have used HTML5, SCSS(CSS3), BEM methodology, Vinilla JavaScript ES6 and basic 
SEO to demonstarte my work.

The idea of a website appealled to me; as I wanted to showcase me skills, my web design 
and development.  I hope to have achieved this throughout the use of multiple web pages, 
which I hope is filled with useful information.  By keeping it simple I have displayed 
only what is needed.

I have used keyword research, meta tags, sitemap.xml, robots.txt and semantics to improve 
my SEO.

Kind regards

James Forster
